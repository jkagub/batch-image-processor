# Image Processing Script

This Python script processes images in a specified folder, performing the following operations for each image:
1. Rotate the image 90Â° anti-clockwise.
2. Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128.
3. Convert images with modes 'RGBA', 'LA', and 'P' to RGB mode, if necessary.
4. Save the processed images in JPEG format to a new folder.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (PIL)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

1. Place your images in the `images` folder.
2. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python script.py
```

3. Processed images will be saved in the `opt/icons` folder.

## Note

- If the script encounters an image that is not a valid image file, it will display an error message and skip processing that file.

- Some images may not be saved if they have unsupported color modes. The script will display an error message for those cases.
